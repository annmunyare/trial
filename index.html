    <p class="author">The dummy text I put in here is called lorem Ipsum text.
       It looks like Latin but is actually just a bunch of fake words.
       Lorem ipsum text is often used as a placeholder when doing design;
      you can search online for lorem ipsum and find many
      websites where you can copy the text. </p>
